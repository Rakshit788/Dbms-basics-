Ques2 Wrrite a short note on filebase stroage system . Explain the major challenges of file based manegement system.

ANS = The file base stroage system is a traditional way of sorting and arranging the data , where data is stored is
stored in indivisual file of the computer . The data in each file is sorted in simple flat structure with no
relationship established between the files .
Major Challenges Faced:

Data Redundency - It occurs when same type of data is stored in multiple files or locations .

Security - File based storage system are often less secure than data base manegement system . In file based storage it
is difficult to know that who has acess to your data and what changes they have made with it .

Data Isolation- Data isolation refers to the fact that in a file-based storage system, data is often stored in separate
files, which makes it difficult to access and share data across different applications or systems.

Limited Scalability: File-based storage systems are often not very scalable. As the amount of data in the system grows,
it can become increasingly difficult to manage and maintain the system.
