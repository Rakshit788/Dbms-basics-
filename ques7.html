    <h1>Explain 3 Schema architecture and its advantages</h1>
    <p>
        <b> 1 External Schema (View Level): </b>

        Description: The external schema represents how data is viewed by specific user groups or applications. It
        focuses on the individual user's perception of the data and defines the logical structure and organization of
        the data as seen by that user.
        <br> Advantages: <br>
        Data Independence: Changes to the external schema do not affect the conceptual or internal schema. This provides
        a level of data independence, allowing modifications to be made for specific user needs without impacting the
        overall database structure.
    </p>



    <p>
        <b> 2 Conceptual Schema (Logical Level): </b>

        Description: The conceptual schema represents the entire logical structure of the database, independent of how
        the data is viewed or accessed by end-users. It defines the relationships, constraints, and rules that govern
        the entire database.
        <br> Advantages: <br>
        Data Independence: Changes to the conceptual schema do not affect external schemas. This provides a level of
        data independence, allowing modifications to the overall structure without impacting how users interact with the
        data.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>3 Internal Schema (Physical Level):

        </b>
    <p> Description: The internal schema represents how data is physically stored and accessed by the computer system.
        It defines the storage structures, file organization, indexing mechanisms, and access paths used to optimize
        data retrieval and storage. </p>
        <br> Advantages: 
        
        Performance Optimization: Design decisions at the internal schema level aim to optimize data storage and
        retrieval for efficient performance. This includes considerations such as indexing, clustering, and storage
        allocation.
