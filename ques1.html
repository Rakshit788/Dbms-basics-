Ques1 What is Database .Explain with example why do we need a database . 

ANS :
A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way to easily manage, update, and retrieve
information. It is like a digital filing system that stores and organizes data so that it can be easily accessed,
managed, and updated.

Example:
Let's consider a scenario of a company that sells products. They have information about their products, customers, and
orders. Instead of storing this information in separate files or spreadsheets, they can use a database to organize and
manage it more efficiently.

In this case, the database might have tables for "Products," "Customers," and "Orders." Each table would have columns
representing different attributes (e.g., product ID, product name, customer ID, customer name, order ID, etc.), and rows
would represent individual records.
