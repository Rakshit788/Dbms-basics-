    <h1>What is the significance of Data Modelling and explain types of Data Modelling</h1>
    <p>
        Data modeling is a crucial aspect of database design and information system development. It involves creating
        abstract representations of the structure and relationships within a database. The primary goal of data modeling
        is to ensure that the data is organized, stored, and processed efficiently while meeting the business
        requirements. Here are the key types of data modeling:</p>
    <p><b>Conceptual Data Modeling: </b>

        Significance: Conceptual data modeling is the initial phase of data modeling, focusing on the high-level
        representation of business concepts and relationships without going into technical details. It helps
        stakeholders, including business users and analysts, to understand and communicate the data requirements.</p>
    <p>
        <b> Logical Data Modeling: </b>

        Significance: Logical data modeling translates the conceptual model into a more detailed structure that can be
        implemented in a database management system (DBMS). It defines tables, columns, relationships, and constraints,
        providing a blueprint for database developers.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Physical Data Modeling: </b>

        Significance: Physical data modeling involves defining the specific implementation details of the database,
        considering storage structures, indexing, and optimization for a particular DBMS. It addresses performance and
        storage considerations.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Relational Data Modeling: </b>

        Significance: Relational data modeling is a type of logical data modeling specific to relational database
        management systems (RDBMS). It defines tables, relationships, and constraints to ensure data integrity in a
        relational database.
