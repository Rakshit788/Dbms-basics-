    <h1>List out different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in Depth ?</h1>
    <p><b>>Hierarchical Classification: </b>

        In hierarchical classification, data is organized in a tree-like structure with a top-down relationship. Each
        parent node can have multiple child nodes, forming a hierarchy. This model is not widely used in modern
        databases but can be found in certain specialized systems.</p>
    <p><b>Network Classification: </b>

        Network databases organize data using a more flexible model than hierarchical databases. Records can have
        multiple parent and child records, creating a network-like structure. This model is also less common today..</p>

    <p><b>Relational Classification: </b>

        Relational databases organize data into tables with rows and columns. Relationships between tables are
        established using keys. This model, based on the principles of relational algebra, is the most widely used in
        contemporary database systems..</p>
    <p><b>Object-Oriented Classification: </b>

        Object-oriented databases store data in the form of objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. This model is
        useful for representing complex relationships and is commonly used in object-oriented programming environments.
    </p>
    <p> <b>Document-Oriented Classification: </b>

        Document-oriented databases store and retrieve data in the form of documents, typically using formats like JSON
        or BSON. These databases are suitable for managing semi-structured or unstructured data..</p>
