Ques What is Database and why do we need it

DBMS (Database Management System):

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that provides an interface for interacting with databases. It
facilitates the creation, organization, management, and retrieval of data in a database. A DBMS acts as an intermediary
between the user and the database, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible.

Need of DBMS :

Data Organization: A DBMS organizes data in a structured manner, using tables with rows and columns. This structure
makes it easy to locate and access specific pieces of information.

Data Integrity: DBMS systems enforce data integrity by implementing rules and constraints. This ensures that data
entered into the database meets certain standards and remains accurate.

Data Security: DBMS systems provide mechanisms for securing data. Access controls can be set to restrict unauthorized
users from viewing or modifying specific data.

Concurrent Access: In multi-user environments, where multiple users need to access the database simultaneously, a DBMS
ensures that transactions are processed in a way that maintains data consistency.

Data Retrieval and Querying: DBMS systems offer powerful query languages that enable users to retrieve specific data
based on various criteria. This facilitates efficient data retrieval for analysis and reporting.
